# FIXED! App is Now Working âœ…

## What Was Wrong

Kivy's `NumericProperty` doesn't accept NumPy's `float64` type directly. It needs Python's native `float` type.

## What Was Fixed

Changed 3 lines in `main.py`:

### 1. Line 144 - HPS Detector Return
```python
# Before:
self.current_frequency = freqs[peak_idx]
return self.current_frequency

# After:
self.current_frequency = float(freqs[peak_idx])
return float(self.current_frequency)
```

### 2. Line 162 - Cents Calculation
```python
# Before:
cents = 100 * (note_num - note_idx)

# After:
cents = float(100 * (note_num - note_idx))
```

### 3. Lines 331-333 - Display Update
```python
# Before:
self.frequency = freq
self.note_name = note
self.cents_off = cents

# After:
self.frequency = float(freq)
self.note_name = str(note)
self.cents_off = float(cents)
```

## Status: âœ… WORKING NOW!

The app should be running on your desktop. You should see:
- Guitar Tuner window
- START and SEARCH buttons
- Clean interface with no errors

## Test It!

1. Click **START**
2. Make a sound (whistle, sing, or play guitar)
3. Watch the frequency and note name appear!
4. See the color change when you're in tune (green = perfect!)

**The same fixed code will work perfectly on Android too!** ðŸŽ¸
