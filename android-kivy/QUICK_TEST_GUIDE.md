## Android Device Test - Two Methods

### Method A: Build APK Locally (Recommended)

#### Requirements
- Android device with USB debugging enabled
- USB cable
- 20-60 minutes for first build (downloads Android SDK/NDK)
- Linux or macOS (Windows requires WSL)

#### Steps

1. **Enable USB Debugging on your Android device:**
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times to enable Developer Options
   - Go to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Install Buildozer** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install buildozer cython
   ```

3. **Build and Deploy to Device:**
   ```bash
   cd android-kivy
   
   # Connect your device via USB first!
   
   # Build APK and install directly to device
   buildozer android debug deploy run
   ```

4. **First Build Notes:**
   - Takes 20-60 minutes (downloads Android SDK, NDK, etc.)
   - Requires ~4GB of disk space
   - Subsequent builds are much faster (2-5 minutes)

5. **Grant Microphone Permission:**
   - When app launches, allow microphone access
   - If you miss it, go to Settings > Apps > ChordImporter > Permissions

#### Troubleshooting

**If buildozer fails:**
```bash
# Check Java is installed
java -version

# If not, install Java 11 or higher:
# Windows: https://adoptium.net/
# Linux: sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
# macOS: brew install openjdk@11
```

**If device not detected:**
```bash
# Check device is connected
adb devices

# If no devices shown:
# - Ensure USB debugging is enabled
# - Try a different USB cable
# - Authorize the computer on your device
```

### Method B: Transfer APK File (Easier for Windows)

If you're on Windows and don't want to set up WSL, you can build on a cloud service or Linux machine, then transfer the APK.

#### Steps

1. **Build APK** (on Linux/Mac or cloud):
   ```bash
   cd android-kivy
   buildozer android debug
   ```
   APK will be in: `bin/chordimporter-*-debug.apk`

2. **Transfer to Phone:**
   - Option 1: Email the APK to yourself
   - Option 2: Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
   - Option 3: Use USB file transfer
   - Option 4: Use `adb install bin/chordimporter-*-debug.apk`

3. **Install on Phone:**
   - Open the APK file on your phone
   - Tap "Install" (may need to allow "Install from Unknown Sources")
   - Grant microphone permission when prompted

---

### Method C: Use GitHub Actions (Automated Cloud Build)

Build APK automatically using GitHub Actions (no local build needed!).

#### Steps

1. **Push code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add android-kivy/
   git commit -m "Add Android version"
   git push
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Actions workflow:**
   Create `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Build Android APK
   
   on: [push, workflow_dispatch]
   
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: '3.11'
         
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             pip install buildozer cython
             sudo apt-get update
             sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk
         
         - name: Build APK
           working-directory: android-kivy
           run: buildozer android debug
         
         - name: Upload APK
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
           with:
             name: android-apk
             path: android-kivy/bin/*.apk
   ```

3. **Download APK:**
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Download the artifact
   - Transfer to your phone and install
