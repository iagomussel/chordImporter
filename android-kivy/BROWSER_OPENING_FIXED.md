# ✅ Browser Opening Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

When you click on search results or library songs, they now properly open in the browser on **both Desktop and Android**!

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Problem
The app was using Python's `webbrowser` module which:
- ✅ Works on desktop
- ❌ Doesn't work properly on Android

### Solution
Added Android-native browser opening using **Intents**:

```python
def open_url(url):
    """Open URL in browser - works on Android and Desktop"""
    if ANDROID_BROWSER:
        # Use Android's native Intent system
        intent = Intent()
        intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
        intent.setData(Uri.parse(url))
        currentActivity = PythonActivity.mActivity
        currentActivity.startActivity(intent)
    else:
        # Use standard webbrowser for desktop
        webbrowser.open(url)
```

## 📱 How It Works Now

### On Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux):
1. Click search result or library song
2. Opens in your default browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
3. Uses Python's `webbrowser` module

### On Android:
1. Click search result or library song
2. Android asks which browser to use (if multiple installed)
3. Opens in Chrome, Firefox, Samsung Internet, etc.
4. Uses Android's Intent system (native)

## 🎯 What Opens in Browser

### Search Screen:
When you search for songs and click a result:
- Opens Cifra Club chord page
- Opens Ultimate Guitar tab page
- Opens any chord/tab website

### Library Screen:
When you click a saved song:
- Opens the URL you saved
- Direct link to the chord/tab page

### Android (After Deployment):
1. Deploy to phone: `buildozer android debug deploy run`
2. Open ChordImporter app
